Welcome to my UI. I hope you like it.
The HB_UI_Initializer is the container for each file in this folder, except the map and wrapper.
That is because the scaling does not work for components that are spread out too much, aka the map and bp/inventory.
The Initializer is then initialized in GameSprite.

In Options.as combined with Parameters.as I make the UI toggleable.
And that is also linked ultimately in Gamesprite.

To scale the UI i created static functions in Screenparameters. Which is executed also in GameSprite.
You might need to change/add "stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;  stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;"
in WebMain -> setup, for the scaling to work. Also here is a tutorial on how to do proper mscale for the rest of the game

To make the miniMap work I used the prebuilt one and disconnected it from hudView. Basically I used MiniMap_Mediator.
So I did it by creating 3 new files, MiniMap_Initializer, the mediator and the signal, and some code added to gamesprite,
and to gamesprite's mediator, but not 100% sure how much that is needed.

To get the inventory and backpack work with the buttons in HB_UI_Initializer I used references and a wrapper.
